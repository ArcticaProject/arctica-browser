# Arctica Web Browser

The Arctica Web Browser brings back performant web browser experience to remote (Linux based) desktop sessions.

## Installation

There is nothing really to install, except from a test version.

So brave test users may dive in deeper [by studying the ArcticaBrowser documentation](https://github.com/ArcticaProject/ArcticaDocs/blob/master/ArcticaBrowser).
